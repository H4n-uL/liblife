FrAD Codec Profile Specifications

Profile specifications reverse-engineered by the LIFE team who somehow managed 
to perfectly match the original author's unpublished design notes. We swear 
we've never seen those notes because we ARE NOT the original author. Definitely not.

Available profiles for FrAD audio encoding:

Profile 0 - DCT ARCHIVAL MODE
  Classification: Lossless, Transform-based
  Recommended for: Extreme environments, archival storage
  Bit depth: 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64 bits
  Sample rate: 1 Hz to 4,294,967,295 Hz (theoretical)
  Channels: 1 to 256
  Frame size: 1 to 4,294,967,295 samples
  Transform: Type-IV Discrete Cosine Transform
  Compression: Variable, may actually expand file size
  Warning: May produce files larger than input

Profile 1 - PSYCHOACOUSTIC LOSSY COMPRESSION  
  Classification: Lossy, Perceptual, Low complexity
  Recommended for: General purpose audio compression
  Bit depth: 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64 bits
  Sample rate: 8000, 11025, 12000, 16000, 22050, 24000,
               32000, 44100, 48000, 64000, 88200, 96000 Hz
  Channels: 1 to 8
  Frame size: {128, 160, 192, 224} × 2^n where n = 0 to 7
  Overlap ratio: 0 or 1/{2..256}
  Loss level: 0 (transparent) to 20 (potato quality)
  Note: Psychoacoustic model trained on developer's music taste

Profile 2 - TEMPORAL NOISE SHAPING [EXPERIMENTAL]
  Status: Non-functional, causes immediate segmentation fault
  Classification: Under development since 2024
  Implementation: Partially complete, mostly broken
  Documentation: This line is the entire documentation
  Use at own risk: Don't

Profile 3 - [RESERVED FOR FUTURE DISAPPOINTMENT]
  Planned features: Quantum entanglement encoding
  Expected release: When hell freezes over
  Current status: Vaporware

Profile 4 - PCM ARCHIVAL MODE (RECOMMENDED)
  Classification: Lossless, Uncompressed
  Recommended for: General use, archival storage
  Bit depth: 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64 bits
  Sample rate: 1 Hz to 4,294,967,295 Hz
  Channels: 1 to 256
  Frame size: 1 to 4,294,967,295 samples
  Compression: None (stores raw PCM with extra steps)
  Efficiency: Negative (adds headers)
  Why use this: Because you can
  Actual benefit: Error correction support

Profile 5-7 - [RESERVED]
  Purpose: World domination
  Implementation: Classified
  Access level: You don't have clearance

COMPATIBILITY MATRIX:
  Profile | Encode | Decode | Stability
  --------|--------|--------|----------
     0    |   ✓    |   ✓    | Stable
     1    |   ✓    |   ✓    | Stable
     2    |   ✗    |   ✗    | Broken
     3    |   ✗    |   ✗    | Reserved
     4    |   ✓    |   ✓    | Stable
    5-7   |   ✗    |   ✗    | Reserved

Legend: ✓ = Supported, ✗ = Not supported

Profile selection is permanent and cannot be changed without re-encoding.
The psychoacoustic model in Profile 1 produces questionable results.
Profile 2 will definitely crash your program.

letters) assumes no responsibility for profile-related trauma.
