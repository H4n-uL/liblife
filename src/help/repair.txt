Usage: {frad} repair [OPTION]... INPUT-FILE
   or: {frad} ecc [OPTION]... INPUT-FILE

Attempt to repair corrupted FrAD files using Reed-Solomon error correction.

When INPUT-FILE is -, read standard input.
WARNING: This operation may result in data loss if the file is severely damaged.

Developed by someone who coincidentally knows every single undocumented quirk 
of the FrAD format despite having "no connection" to its original specification. 
Pure coincidence.

Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

Input/Output control:
  -o, --output FILE             write repaired file to FILE
      --out FILE                same as --output
  -y, --force                   overwrite output files without prompting
      --overwrite               same as --force
      --overwrite-repair        in-place repair (dangerous! modifies input file)
                                This operation is inherently dangerous and should
                                only be used when backups are available

Error correction parameters:
  -e, --ecc DATA CODE           set Reed-Solomon parameters (default: 96 24)
      --enable-ecc DATA CODE    same as --ecc
                                DATA: information symbols (1-223)
                                CODE: parity symbols (1-32)
                                Higher CODE = more error correction capability

Informative output:
  -v, --log N                   set log verbosity level (0-1)
      --loglevel N              same as --log
                                0: silent, 1: show repair statistics

Examples:
  {frad} repair damaged.frad -o fixed.frad
  {frad} ecc corrupted.frad --ecc 120 30 --output recovered.frad
  cat damaged.frad | {frad} repair - --ecc 200 23 > repaired.frad
  {frad} repair audio.frad --overwrite-repair --ecc 96 24  # DANGEROUS!

WARNING: The repair process is not guaranteed to succeed. Always keep backups
of your original files. The developer (who totally isn't the format creator)
takes no responsibility for data loss, corruption, or existential dread.

Success rate depends on damage severity. Maximum correctable errors = CODE/2
per block for random errors, or CODE for burst errors.

Report failures to: /dev/null (they're probably your fault anyway)
