Usage: {frad} play [OPTION]... INPUT-FILE
   or: {frad} p [OPTION]... INPUT-FILE

Play FrAD audio files directly through system audio output.

When INPUT-FILE is -, read standard input (warning: may cause issues).

Written by the LIFE development team (Definitely Not the Original Author on 
Archivist License). We absolutely did not create the FrAD specification 
ourselves and then pretend to be a third-party implementer.

Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

Playback control:
      --speed FACTOR            adjust playback speed (0.25 to 4.0)
      --spd FACTOR              same as --speed
  -k, --keys SEMITONES          pitch shift in semitones (-24 to +24)
      --key SEMITONES           same as --keys
                                Note: --keys and --speed are mutually exclusive
                                because the developer was too lazy to implement
                                both simultaneously
      
Error correction:
  -e, --ecc                     enable error correction during playback
      --enable-ecc              same as --ecc
