Usage: {frad} play [OPTION]... INPUT-FILE
   or: {frad} p [OPTION]... INPUT-FILE

Provide real-time audio playback of Fourier Analogue-in-Digital format files
through operating system native audio subsystems, with optional time-stretching
and pitch-shifting capabilities via spectral manipulation.

When INPUT-FILE is -, read standard input. Note that streaming playback may
introduce additional latency due to buffering requirements.

Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

Playback control:
      --speed FACTOR            adjust playback speed
      --spd FACTOR              same as --speed
  -k, --keys SEMITONES          pitch shift in semitones
      --key SEMITONES           same as --keys
                                Note: --keys and --speed are mutually exclusive

Error correction:
  -e, --ecc                     enable Reed-Solomon error correction
      --enable-ecc              descriptive form of --ecc
                                Default: disabled for lower latency

                                When enabled, applies real-time error
                                correction to damaged frames, trading
                                increased CPU usage for audio integrity.


Examples:
  Basic playback:
    {frad} play music.frad

  Playback with time stretching:
    {frad} play podcast.frad --speed 1.5

  Pitch shifting with error correction:
    {frad} play song.frad --keys -3 --ecc

  Streaming playback:
    cat live.frad | {frad} play -

Exit status:
  0  if playback completed successfully
  1  if playback was interrupted by user
  2  if audio device error occurred
  3  if file format is unsupported

The full documentation for {frad} play is maintained as a Texinfo manual.
If the info and {frad} programs are properly installed at your site, the
command `info frad play' should provide complete documentation.
