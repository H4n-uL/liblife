Fourier Analogue-in-Digital: A comprehensive audio codec implementation
utilizing advanced spectral decomposition methodologies for both lossless and
lossy compression of pulse-code modulated digital audio streams.

This program conforms to the POSIX.1-2017 specification for command-line
interface conventions. Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for
short options too. The ordering of options relative to file arguments is not
significant except where explicitly documented. When an option is specified
multiple times, the last occurrence takes precedence, unless the option
explicitly supports multiple invocations through accumulation or list-building
semantics.

Operands are interpreted as pathnames of input files relative to the current
working directory unless they begin with '/' (indicating an absolute path). If
the operand consists solely of a hyphen-minus character `-', the program shall
read from the standard input stream. Multiple file operands are processed
sequentially in left-to-right order as they appear on the command line, with
appropriate error handling and recovery mechanisms for inaccessible or malformed
inputs.

Main operation modes (mutually exclusive):
  encode, enc               transform Pulse Code Modulated audio data streams
                           into the Fourier Analogue-in-Digital format through
                           spectral decomposition and psychoacoustic modeling
                           algorithms
  decode, dec               reconstruct Pulse Code Modulated audio data from
                           Fourier Analogue-in-Digital format containers using
                           inverse discrete Fourier transformation techniques
  repair, ecc               initiate Reed-Solomon Forward Error Correction
                           algorithms for damaged bitstream recovery with
                           configurable redundancy ratios and interleaving depth
  play, p                   direct audio playback through operating system
                           native audio subsystems (ALSA/PulseAudio on
                           GNU/Linux, CoreAudio on macOS, WASAPI on Windows NT
                           derivatives)
  meta, metadata            manipulate the extensible metadata chunk subsystem
                           with full RFC 8259 compliant JSON support and binary
                           attachment capabilities via Base64 encoding

Extended examples with common use cases:
  Encode a raw PCM file with explicit parameters:
    {frad} encode input.pcm --sample-rate 44100 --channels 2 --bits 16 \
           --output output.frad --profile 4 --ecc 96 24

  Decode with specific output format and error correction:
    {frad} decode input.frad --format s16le --enable-ecc --output output.raw

  Play a FrAD file at modified speed with pitch preservation:
    {frad} play music.frad --speed 1.25

  Repair a corrupted file with maximum redundancy utilization:
    {frad} repair damaged.frad --output repaired.frad --ecc 96 24

  Add metadata to existing file:
    {frad} meta add audio.frad --meta "TITLE" "Symphony No. 9" \
           --meta "ARTIST" "Ludwig van Beethoven"
