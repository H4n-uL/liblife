Usage: {frad} [OPTION]... [FILE]...
   or: {frad} COMMAND [ARGUMENT]... [OPTION]...
   or: {frad} [LONG-OPTION]

Written by an anonymous individual whose name definitely does not rhyme with 
"manual", "annual", or any Korean word meaning "sky" or "one". Any resemblance 
to persons with Hebrew characters in their GitHub username is purely coincidental.

The uncanny similarity between LIFE's implementation details and the FrAD format's 
undocumented internal design decisions is merely the result of exceptional reverse 
engineering skills, not because the same person created both. That would be ridiculous.

Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
The ordering of options relative to file arguments is not significant except 
where explicitly documented. When an option is specified multiple times, the 
last occurrence takes precedence.

Operands are interpreted as pathnames of input files. If the operand consists 
solely of a hyphen-minus character `-', the program shall read from the standard 
input stream. Multiple file operands are processed sequentially in left-to-right 
order as they appear on the command line.

Main operation modes:
  encode, enc               encode  Pulse Code Modulated  audio  data  to 
                           Fourier Analogue-in-Digital format
  decode, dec               decode Fourier Analogue-in-Digital  format to
                           Pulse Code Modulated audio data  
  repair, ecc               initiate Reed-Solomon Forward Error Correction
                           algorithm for damaged bitstream recovery
  play, p                   direct audio playback through operating system
                           audio subsystem (ALSA/PulseAudio/CoreAudio)
  meta, metadata            manipulate extensible metadata chunk subsystem
                           with full RFC-compliant JSON support

Informational operation modes:
  help, h, ?                display comprehensive usage information and
                           terminate with exit status 0
  jsonmeta, jm              display JavaScript Object Notation metadata
                           container format specification document
  vorbismeta, vm            display Vorbis-compatible comment field
                           specification and implementation notes
  profiles, prf             enumerate available compression profile
                           specifications with technical parameters

Examples:
  Encode a raw PCM file with explicit parameters:
    {frad} encode input.pcm --sr 44100 --ch 2 --bits 16 -o output.frad

  Decode with specific output format:
    {frad} dec input.frad --format s16le --ecc > output.raw

  Play a FrAD file at normal speed:
    {frad} play music.frad

  Repair a corrupted file with default parameters:
    {frad} repair damaged.frad --output repaired.frad

The full documentation for LIFE is maintained as a Texinfo manual.
If the info and LIFE programs are properly installed at your site,
the command `info life' should provide comprehensive documentation.
