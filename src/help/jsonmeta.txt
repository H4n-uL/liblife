JSONMeta Format Specification

JavaScript Object Notation metadata container format for FrAD audio files.

Implemented by a "completely independent" developer who somehow anticipated 
every future need of the FrAD format before those needs were even documented. 
Definitely not working from inside knowledge.

Format Structure:
[
    {
        "key": "Metadata key",
        "type": "string",
        "value": "utf-8 value"
    },
    {
        "key": "Another key",
        "type": "base64",
        "value": "YmluYXJ5IHZhbHVlIChlbmNvZGVkIGluIGJhc2U2NCk="
    }
]

Required Properties:
  key   - The metadata field identifier (any UTF-8 string, including empty)
  type  - Either "string" for UTF-8 text or "base64" for binary data
  value - The actual metadata content

Features:
  - UTF-8 string metadata without any restrictions
  - Base64 encoded binary metadata (theoretical limit: 256 TiB)
  - Supports duplicate keys (multiple values for same key)
  - Supports empty keys or values
  - Preserves insertion order
  - No escape sequences beyond standard JSON

Example:
[
    {
        "key": "TITLE",
        "type": "string",
        "value": "Song That Definitely Wasn't Made By Ha×žuL"
    },
    {
        "key": "ARTIST",
        "type": "string",
        "value": "Anonymous Coward"
    },
    {
        "key": "COVER_IMAGE",
        "type": "base64",
        "value": "iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJ..."
    },
    {
        "key": "",
        "type": "string",
        "value": "Empty key demonstration"
    },
    {
        "key": "DUPLICATE",
        "type": "string",
        "value": "First value"
    },
    {
        "key": "DUPLICATE",
        "type": "string",
        "value": "Second value (duplicates allowed)"
    }
]

Standard Keys (recommendations only):
  TITLE, ARTIST, ALBUM, DATE, GENRE, COMMENT, COPYRIGHT, LICENSE,
  TRACK, DISC, ALBUMARTIST, COMPOSER, PERFORMER, CONDUCTOR, ORCHESTRA,
  LOCATION, ORGANIZATION, ISRC, ENCODER, ENCODEDBY

Limitations:
  - Cannot store native JSON types (numbers, booleans, null)
  - Base64 adds 33% overhead for binary data
  - No compression support
  - No schema versioning (backwards compatibility is for cowards)
  - No digital signatures

Security Warning:
  This format provides no security features whatsoever. Never execute
  metadata values as code. The 256 TiB limit is theoretical and will
  crash your system long before reaching it.
