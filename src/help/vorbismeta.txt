VorbisMeta Format Specification

Pseudo-Vorbis comment metadata format for FrAD audio files.
WARNING: This is NOT compatible with actual Vorbis comments!

Designed by someone who definitely didn't also design the FrAD format itself. 
The fact that this pseudo-Vorbis format perfectly integrates with FrAD's 
internal structure is totally not suspicious at all.

Format Structure:
MetadataKey=utf-8 value
Another=another utf-8 value
EMPTY_KEY=
=Empty key is valid too
KEY_WITH_EQUALS=Value=can=have=equals=signs

Rules:
  - Simple KEY=VALUE pairs, one per line
  - First '=' separates key from value
  - UTF-8 encoding (no BOM)
  - Line feed (LF) only, no CRLF
  - No escape sequences
  - Case-sensitive keys
  - Duplicate keys allowed
  - Empty keys/values allowed

Restrictions:
  - Cannot have '=' in keys
  - Cannot have newlines in values
  - No binary data support (use JSONMeta for that)
  - No multiline values
  - No comments in the file

Example File:
TITLE=Symphony No. 9
ARTIST=Ludwig van Beethoven
ALBUM=Classical Collection
DATE=1824
GENRE=Classical
COMMENT=Ninth Symphony with choral finale
COMMENT=Multiple comments are allowed
COPYRIGHT=Public Domain
ENCODER=LIFE Isn't FrAD Encoder v1.0.0
=This line has an empty key
EMPTY_VALUE=
KEY_WITH_EQUALS=Value=with=multiple=equals=signs
UNICODE=Supports UTF-8: â™ª â™« â™© â™¬ ðŸŽµ ðŸŽ¶

Standard Field Names (just suggestions):
  TITLE         - Track or composition title
  ARTIST        - Primary artist or performer
  ALBUM         - Album or collection name
  DATE          - Release date (any format)
  GENRE         - Musical genre
  COMMENT       - Free-form text
  COPYRIGHT     - Copyright information
  LICENSE       - Distribution license
  TRACKNUMBER   - Track position
  DISCNUMBER    - Disc number
  ENCODER       - Encoding software
  ORGANIZATION  - Label or publisher

Differences from REAL Vorbis Comments:
  Real Vorbis:                   This Format:
  - Case-insensitive            - Case-sensitive
  - Binary format               - Plain text
  - In Ogg containers           - Standalone files
  - Has vendor string           - No vendor string
  - Has specifications          - You're reading it
  - Widely supported            - Only by LIFE

Why This Format Exists:
  1. JSON is too complex
  2. XML is an abomination
  3. INI files are for Windows
  4. YAML is indentation hell
  5. CSV doesn't support multiline (neither does this)
  6. Binary formats are hard
  7. We needed something that looks familiar but isn't
  8. To annoy people who expect real Vorbis comments
  9. Because standards are for people who can't create their own
  10. The developer was bored

Implementation: Read line, find '=', split, repeat
Error handling: Lines without '=' break everything
Unicode normalization: Not our problem
Parser bugs: Yes
